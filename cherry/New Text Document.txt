			               "Every day may not be good ,but there's something good in every day "


                                  There will be ups and downs in your life but it is significant to realise that these are the 				                          lessons of your life. You should be able to understand that every day may not be good.
                                  That doesn’t mean that you should lose hope for anything.


                           I am Reddy Mukesh Charan and  I am enhancing CSE  with AIML(artificial intelligence and machine learning) in Lovely  	  	           Professional University. 
	                   from the first week the classes had started each and every class is quite good. Compared  to all the classes I  would 	                   love HTML more than the other subjects. Not only academics there are so many sports offered by university which we can 			   play and grow our fitness. After the 3rd week of classes they started assessments as much as i can i have scored well . 			   As the days are passing,
	 		   I have learned a lot . In this university of this diversity is in that level so that your communication will get boost 			   up perfectly. 


	 		   As my goal is to become a software developer at Google. Along the way, I've learned how the skills or experiences, 	 			   faced challenges required to crack the interview & job.
			   One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is the power of Time. When things don’t go as planned, it’s important to pause, 			   reflect, and restart. As the only thing i believe in is every single second is new to us, so chase your goals as lion 			   roars.


        		   Finally I’m grateful to my lovable Faculty Mrs. Shambhavi Singh for helping me develop my communication skills, who 	   			   have been invaluable in providing guidance and encouragement throughout my life journey.
			   I'm excited for the next chapter in my career and always open to connecting with other professionals.
